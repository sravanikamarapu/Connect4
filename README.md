# Connect4

The Connect Four game typically consists of the following components:

1. Board: A grid of 7 columns and 6 rows where the game is played.

2. Pieces: Two sets of pieces, one for each player, usually in different colors. The pieces are round discs that fit into the slots on the board.

3. Rules: The game is played by dropping pieces into the columns of the board. The pieces stack up from the bottom of the column, and the objective is to connect four pieces of the same color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

4. Game Logic: The game logic involves keeping track of the moves made by each player, checking for a winning combination after each move, and determining when the game is over.
